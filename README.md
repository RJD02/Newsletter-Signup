# SignUp Today
## The website is up [here](https://powerful-fjord-82602.herokuapp.com/)

### Signup page merged with Mailchimp API
When you sign up on the page, your data goes to the mailchimp database.
You are added to my audience through an API key.
For this project I extensively used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and in-built https module for exchange of data.
Basically, there are three pages, homepage, success and failure page. And based on your request-response either one gets triggered.

Recently, I modified this page for guidance, as I was about to start giving guidance, but I will change it back to Newsletter soon.
